	l Abbas and Ruanne Abou-Rahme\, Chitra Ganesh\, Amar Kanwar\, Ana María Mi
	llán\, Michael Rakowitz\, and Rattana Vandy at the Francis Kite Club\, fol
	lowed by a Q&A with curator Mari Spirito. Included artists transform the t
	angible aftermaths of tyrannical acts and conditions by filming that which
	 has been prohibited\; revisiting historical events through personal\, con
	temporary narratives\; adopting the look and feel of video games and comic
	 books\; and reinventing myths and stories. In doing so\, they defy rigid 
	perspectives on survival. This screening reflects the growth of methodolog
	ies that use knowledge gained in the endurance of horrors\, emphasizing th
	e fluid\, elastic\, and possible\, as well as revealing the potential to n
	avigate around what seems immovable\, rather than meeting it head-on. With
	in these works\, the critical question becomes\, “What grows from the ashe
	s?”
