DESCRIPTION:Join us on December 16th-17th from 2pm to 9pm at the Sheung Wan
	 Studio for a pop-up event as we celebrate the release of Matt Force's lat
	est EP <LAND>.\n\nMatt Force\, an artist from the Hong Kong based music la
	bel Wildstyle Records\, is one of the very few artists in the city’s hip-h
	op music scene who specializes in both rapping and beat making. Since the 
	release of his self-titled\, self-produced debut album MATT FORCE in 2019\
	, he firmly established his very own unique style through the combination 
	of his Cantonese lyricism\, classic 90s hip-hop groove\, mixed with a jazz
	y sound. The music video of his first single “Farewell (告別)” has compiled 
	over one million views. Along with the hit single\, “Deadly Perfume (死亡香)”
	 and “If I Die Tomorrow” are the two songs on the album which showcase his
	 ability to match his\npoetic lyrics with classic drum sounds and jazz sam
	ples\, creating a sound which feels\nmelancholy yet relaxed. While samplin
	g is about reinventing and bringing new lives to old records\, he also str
	ives to make hip hop music as musical as it can get by adding his own musi
	cal ideas to the samples\, even composing from scratch while still keeping
	\nthe essence of the true hip hop sound. As the artiste continues to grow\
	, he recently progressed to incorporating live instruments into his music 
	and playing with a full jazz band during his recent live sets.
