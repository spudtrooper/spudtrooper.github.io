DESCRIPTION:\nFeeling rushed and overwhelmed? Please join us for a moment o
	f pause and presence to end the year on a positive note. We are so busy wi
	th our daily lives\, our minds are always rushing somewhere else and many 
	times we forget to enjoy the precious present.\n\nCome and share this Mind
	fulness Monday together so we can slow down\, pause\, reflect and learn to
	 stay a bit more in the moment with joy and gratitude.\n\n*This session is
	 open to all levels. If you are new to mindfulness or an experienced pract
	itioner\, come share this moment with us. With simple guidance\, love and 
	kindness\, we will set an intention and do some simple mindfulness practic
	es together that might leave you feeling a bit more grounded\, calm and gr
	ateful.
