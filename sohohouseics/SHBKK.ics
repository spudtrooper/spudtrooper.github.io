DESCRIPTION:Step into the enriching world of breathwork with the "Vital Bre
	ath Workshop: Awakening Pranayama with Rahul." This workshop invites you o
	n a transformative journey\, exploring the ancient practice of Pranayama\,
	 a cornerstone of yogic science known for its profound impact on the mind\
	, body\, and spirit.\n\nLed by Rahul\, a seasoned practitioner with deep r
	oots in yogic tradition\, this workshop offers a blend of learning\, pract
	ice\, and personal exploration. Rahul begins with an introduction to the c
	ore principles of Pranayama\, explaining not only the techniques but also 
	the philosophy and science behind them. This foundation sets the stage for
	 a deeper understanding and a more meaningful practice.\n\nAs the workshop
	 unfolds\, Rahul guides participants through various Pranayama techniques.
	 From the energizing effects of Kapalbhati\, known as the Skull Shining Br
	eath\, to the invigorating Bhastrika\, or Bellows Breath\, each technique 
	is carefully chosen for its unique benefits. Participants will also explor
	e Anulom Vilom\, the Alternate Nostril Breathing\, a practice that brings 
	balance and calm to the nervous system.\n\nBut this workshop is more than 
	just learning techniques. Rahul emphasizes the application of Pranayama in
	 daily life\, offering insights on integrating these practices into your d
	aily routine for stress reduction\, improved concentration\, and overall w
	ell-being. He ensures that every participant\, regardless of their experie
	nce level\, finds value and personal growth in the practices taught.\n\nIn
	terwoven with the physical practices are elements of mindfulness and medit
	ation. Rahul demonstrates how Pranayama can enhance meditative practices\,
	 leading to deeper states of relaxation and awareness. This holistic appro
	ach ensures that participants leave not just with a set of techniques\, bu
	t with a transformative experience that can enrich their personal and spir
	itual journey.\n\nThe "Vital Breath Workshop: Awakening Pranayama with Rah
	ul" is an invitation to dive deep into the world of yogic breathwork. It's
	 an opportunity to awaken your inner vitality\, find a new sense of peace\
	, and embark on a path of self-discovery and renewal. Join Rahul for a day
	 of exploration and leave feeling rejuvenated\, centered\, and empowered.

DESCRIPTION:Get Glammed out à la tropics this New Year’s Eve with our Thai 
	Thai Sabai Style ‘Sarong Social Club’-themed party! Think Jim Thompson sou
	rcing delicate silks in the 50s\, Stevie Nicks with her shawls\, wraps and
	 kaftans of the 70s\, Bowie\, Iman\, Jagger and Hall in Bali circa 1980s\,
	 and Posh and Becks’ Sarong-gate of the late 90s\, It’s all about effortle
	ss style. It’s our nod to Black-tie with a twist - Proper on top and all ‘
	party’ on the bottom. Sparkle and shine as we leave the past behind and da
	nce into the future in a state of flow and glow surrounded by friends and 
	loved ones and good vibrations.
