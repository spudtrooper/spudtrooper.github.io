DESCRIPTION:The sound journey goes behind quieting the mind\, itâ€™s a practi
	ce that takes you into the depth of your being\, where you can experience 
	a range of spiritual\, emotional\, and physiological benefits. The practic
	e combines Yoga Nidra\, it balances the nerves system\, cancels the harmfu
	l impact of long term stress and anxieties\, releases fears\, insecurities
	 and reduces depression. As a result from that the concentration level is 
	higher\, the memory improves and the ability to respond to changes is fast
	er and more efficient. All the above will impact the choices\, behaviors\,
	 relationships\, work\, and the overall health of a person.
