DESCRIPTION:Chef Colter Peck of Austin's own Elementary puts on a special o

	tchen focusing on the simplicity of ingredient and how food can enhance co
	mmunity. From slicing herbs\, to braising beef cheeks\, to visiting the fa
	rmers market\, every day was full of beauty and wonder. He continued to fu
	el my desire to learn and connect with others by moving to northern Idaho\
	, Portland\, Boulder\, and finally Austin. Now Peck brings a special menu 
	curated for Soho House and paired with Teeling Whiskey cocktails. \n\n*Ple
	ase note this is a ticketed event. Tickets can be purchased at the link be
