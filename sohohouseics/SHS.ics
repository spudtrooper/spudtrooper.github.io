DESCRIPTION:The Saturn Return is one of the most feared transits in Astrolo
	gy\, the first one occurring between the ages of 27 to 30. It’s the astrol
	ogical coming-of-age moment and generally comes escorted by major life cha
	nges\, like switching jobs or careers\, breakups\, engagements\, purchasin
	g homes etc. Saturn is the slowest of the traditional planets and marks th
	e edge of the solar system that we can see with the naked eye. Therefore\,
	 Saturn is the ultimate reality check - connected with boundaries and rest
	rictions\, but also commitment\, hard work\, responsibility and making imp
	ortant life goals. This talk will focus on how to make your Saturn Return 
	work for you. You can view your current horoscope for the month by Clariss
	e on SHAPP in the Health section. \n
